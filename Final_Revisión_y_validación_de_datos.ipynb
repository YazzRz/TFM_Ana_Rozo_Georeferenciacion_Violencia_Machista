            "    \"contenido\": \"Euskadi tiene la tasa más baja de mujeres con orden de protección o medidas cautelares de todas las comunidades autónomas Un total de644 mujeres fueron víctimas de violencia machista y se les implantaron medidas de protecciónen Euskadi el año pasado, lo que supone un incremento del 18,2% respecto a 2015, aunque el País Vasco es la comunidad autónoma con menor tasa de este tipo de maltrato. El Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) ha dado hoy a conocer los datos de las víctimas con medidas cautelares o de protección que se inscribieron en 2016 en el Registro Central del Ministerio de Justicia. En la estadística se observa la evolución de las víctimas de violencia machista con medidas de protección desde 2012, cuando en Euskadi fueron 675, bajaron a 610 en 2013, a 577 en 2014 y a 545 en 2015, pero en 2016 hubo un importante repunte hasta las 644. Sin embargo, la tasa de víctimas de violencia de género con orden de protección o medidas cautelares por cada 1.000 mujeres de 14 años o más pone de manifiesto que Euskadi tiene la más baja de todas las comunidades autónomas,0,7 casos por millar, frente a la media nacional de 1,4víctimas por cada mil mujeres. Por otra parte, el INE ha informado de que el año pasado hubo en Euskadi 307 víctimas de violencia doméstica con órdenes de protección o medidas cautelares, un 1,7% más que en 2015 y un 7% más que en 2012. De las 307 víctimas del año pasado, 164 eran mujeres y 123 hombres, ya que este tipo de violencia es la ejercida tanto por un hombre como por una mujer contra un familiar. El incremento interanual de este tipo de víctimas en Euskadi contrasta con la evolución del conjunto nacional, donde se registró un descenso del 5,1%. En España el INE destaca también el aumento del número de víctimas de violencia machista de más de 75 años, ya que se incrementó un 14,6 % en 2016, mientras que las menores maltratadas con medidas cautelares bajaron un 10,7%. En total, el número de víctimas de violencia de género con orden de protección fue de 28.281 mujeres -un 2,4 por ciento más que en 2015- y los hombres denunciados 28.201 -aumentaron un 2,3%-. Respecto a la violencia doméstica, una de cada cuatro víctimas con protección es menor (de las 6.863 víctimas con medidas cautelares hubo 1.585 menores). Por comunidades autónomas, las que tuvieron un mayor número de víctimas inscritas por maltrato fueron Andalucía (6.913), Valencia (4.067) y Madrid (3.200); las que registraron un menor número fueron las ciudades autónomas de Ceuta y Melilla y La Rioja. Por tasa de víctimas de violencia de género, las mayores se registraron en Ceuta (2,7) y Andalucía, Valencia y Murcia (con 1,9). Las menores tasas se registraron en País Vasco (0,7), Cataluña (0,8) y Galicia (1,0). Atendiendo al lugar de nacimiento, dos de cada tres víctimas de violencia de género protegidas habían nacido en España (el 67,4% del total) -19.051 españolas y 9.230 extranjeras-, similar a la del año anterior. Respecto a los hombres denunciados por violencia de género -28.201- casi la mitad (48,4%) eran de 30 a 44 años; la edad media de los denunciados fue de 39,5 años. Atendiendo al tipo de relación entre la víctima y el denunciado, en el 23,3% de los casos eran cónyuges, el 23,1 pareja de hecho y en el 6,4 % excónyuges. A diferencia de la violencia de género, la violencia doméstica afectó de manera más uniforme a todas las edades, aunque el 23,1% tenía menos de 18 años; la edad media de las víctimas fue de 41,5 años. La relación en este tipo de violencia entre denunciado y víctima, en el 27,9 de los casos la víctima es la madre del agresor, en el 27,1% las víctimas son los hijos, en el 11,2% el padre y en el 9,8% los hermanos.

            "    \"contenido\": \"Estás leyendo:María Salmerón, en libertad tras cumplir condena por impedir que su hija viera a su padre condenado por violencia machista MADRID Marisa Kohan@kohanm María Salmerónya está en libertad. Tras una condena que la llevó a prisión por un período de nueve meses, ha sido definitivamente puesta en libertad este domingo. El auto de su puesta en libertad fue ratificado por escrito por la subdirectora de tratamiento delCentro de Inserción Social (CIS de Alcalá de Guadaira (Sevilla), donde esta madrehabía ingresado de forma voluntaria en junio del año pasado. Su delito: haber incumplido algunas visitas de su hija con su padre, un hombre del que se separó apenas nacer su hija y al que denunció por violencia de género. Élfue condenado en firme en 2008 por maltrato habitual hacia Salmerón, pena que nunca cumplió por ser inferior a dos años y no tener antecedentes. Desde el momento en que ella lo denunció en 2003,Salmerón vivió un calvario judicial que se prolongó durante más de 20 años. Desde niñasu hija le dijo queno quería ver a su padre, cosa que Salmerón respetó, incumpliendo algunas visitas que su expareja tenía asignadas en un punto de encuentro familiar. Los incumplimientosdatan de los años 2012 a 2014. En 2015, una jueza escuchó a su hija y decretó queMiriam Ruiz Salmerón \\\"verá a su padre cuando quiera, donde quiera y si quiere\\\". Su hija tenía entonces 15 años. Las constantes denuncias de su exmarido ante la justicia, mantuvieron a Salmerón en un limbo judicial, hasta que en 2019 una jueza del juzgado número 6 de Sevilla la condenó a una pena de nueve meses de prisión y a 3.000 euros de indemnización en 2019. La sentencia dictada en 2019 y por la que ha cumplido nueve meses de prisión, afirmaba que María Salmerón era culpable de \\\"un delito de desobediencia grave a la autoridad\\\" por haber obstaculizado las visitas de su hija con su expareja. Salmerónha tenido a lo largo de los últimos 20 años tres indultos parcialesa diversas condenas. Todos ellos concedidos por gobiernos delPartido PopulardeMariano Rajoy, Ejecutivo que incluso la condecoró por su lucha contra la violencia machista. El cuarto indulto fue solicitado tras la última condena de 2019.Más de 300 organizaciones y 500 firmas particulares respaldaron esta petición ante el Ministerio de Justicia. Meses más tarde, la titular de Justicia,Pilar Llop, se lo denegó, sin siquiera consultar con sus socios de Gobierno. Desde elMinisterio de Igualdadhabían manifestado en diversas ocasiones la disposición del Gobierno de concederle un nuevo indulto que evitase su ingreso en prisión. Desde Justicia, Llop argumentó que Salmerón era reincidente y que tenía las manos atadas.Sin embargo, desde su defensa y voces de juristas conocedoras del caso, afirmaron quetodos los antecedentes de Salmerón habían sido ya cancelados o eran cancelables. Estos mensajes, sin embargo, no cambiaron la decisión de la jueza. Desde este lunes, Salmerón está en libertad por haber cumplido la pena impuesta. Desde el 27 de diciembre del año pasado, esta madre disponía de un tercer grado que le permitía trabajar y pernoctar en su casa, con la obligación de llevar siempre una pulsera de localización y no salir de su ciudad.
